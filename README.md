# Frontend Mentor - Product preview card component

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹ This is Alex!

Thanks for checking out my front-end coding challenge.

## The challenge

The challenge is to build out this product preview card component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements
